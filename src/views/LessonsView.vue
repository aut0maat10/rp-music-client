      With 20+ years of experience teaching guitar to hundreds of people of all ages, backgrounds, and levels — private lessons and employed by several music schools and organizations – I offer in-person lessons in the NYC area and Skype lessons worldwide.
      <br/><br>
      I teach electric and acoustic guitar and as a freelance musician, I am fluent in many genres, including pop, rock, blues, folk, funk, soul, R&B, hard rock, metal, country, and jazz. Moreover, I have planned and produced numerous band workshops for children and teenagers, and I have served as music director in theater productions.
      <br/><br>
      For private lessons I like to tailor my lessons to the student’s goals and interests. I like to help students analyze the music they play and apply a healthy dose of music theory for a greater understanding of the building blocks of music of various genres. 
      <br/><br>
      <span class="text-green">My main goal as an educator is to help my students reach their goals, and I take great pride in the fact that several of my former students have pursued successful professional careers in music.</span>
      <br/><br>
      I am happy to help students who are interested in songwriting and music production as well.
